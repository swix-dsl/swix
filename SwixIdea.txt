SimpleWix (Swix) is a small domain-specific language (DSL) aimed at making work with WIX (Windows Installer Xml) easier.
This project provides means to parse *.swix files and transform them to *.wxs which could be consumed by WIX directly.

This transformation could be used at pre-build time of WIX project, thus updating resulting wxs dynamically and convenient
to work either from Visual Studio or without it.

Project does not set as a goal to fully replace WIX, only to make work with it simpler. Thus it is totally possible and 
encouraged to mix handwritten WIX sources with generated from Swix (only do not alter generated files as they would be
regenerated on the very next build).
